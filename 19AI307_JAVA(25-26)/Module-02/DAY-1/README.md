## ALGORITHM :

1.Start.

2.Create a class City with variables: cityName, population, area.

3.Add a method printDetails() to display the values.

4.In main(), create a Scanner object.

    String cityName;
    long population;
    double area;

    // Method to print details
    void printDetails() {
        System.out.println("City Name: " + cityName);
        System.out.println("Population: " + population);
        System.out.println("Area: " + area);
    }
}

class prog {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Create a City object
        City city = new City();

        // Read details from user
        city.cityName = scanner.nextLine();    // Read city name
        city.population = scanner.nextLong();  // Read population
        city.area = scanner.nextDouble();      // Read area

        // Print city details
        city.printDetails();

        scanner.close();
    }
}
